Project: sentiment analysis of YouTube comments and video using AI
YouTube Sentiment AI is a machine learning project focused on analyzing the sentiment of YouTube video comments using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system automatically classifies user comments into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** categories, providing insights into public opinion and emotional response to video content.

Features
* Extracts comments using the **YouTube Data API**
* Cleans and preprocesses text (removing noise, stopwords, etc.)
* Converts text to numerical data using **TF-IDF** or **word embeddings**
* Trains sentiment analysis models like **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, or **deep learning models**
* Analyzes and visualizes overall sentiment trends for specific videos
* Helps content creators and analysts understand viewer engagement

Technologies Used
* Python
* NLP Libraries: NLTK / spaCy
* Machine Learning: scikit-learn / TensorFlow / Keras
* API: YouTube Data API v3
* Visualization: Matplotlib / Seaborn

Applications
* Measuring audience engagement
* Tracking sentiment trends over time
* Assisting brands or creators with content strategy
* Filtering toxic or negative comments

This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence and natural language processing can be used to extract meaningful insights from social media data, especially for content-rich platforms like YouTube.
